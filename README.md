## Getting Started
To run the Django Blog Project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Python
Ensure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Install and Set Up Virtual Environment
1. **Install `virtualenv`** (if not already installed):
    ```sh
    pip install virtualenv
    ```
2. **Create a python virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    ```
3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        env\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

### 3. Install Django and Other Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install Django and other project dependencies:
```sh
pip install django
pip install mysqlclient
```

### 4. Set Up MySQL
Ensure MySQL is installed on your machine. You can download it from [MySQL's official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### 5. Clone the Repository
Clone the Django Blog Project repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd django-blog-project
```

### 6. Configure Database Settings
1. Open the `settings.py` file within your Django project directory.
2. Locate the `DATABASES` setting and configure it to connect to your MySQL database:
    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
            'NAME': 'your_database_name',
            'USER': 'your_mysql_username',
            'PASSWORD': 'your_mysql_password',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '3306',
        }
    }
    ```
    Replace `your_database_name`, `your_mysql_username`, and `your_mysql_password` with your actual MySQL database credentials.

### 7. Apply Migrations
Run the following commands in your terminal to create the necessary database tables:
```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 8. Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server:
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

### 9. Access the Website
Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see your blog website in action.
